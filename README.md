# NeRF-Diffusion
Using diffusion-based generative models to extrapolate unseen views and improve the 3D reconstruction of Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields


# Brainstorming Questions

### Stereo: 

What is the effectiveness of SpareFusion with stereo input? Is it sufficient to have two different views of the object (stereo) for nearby objects, or do we need very different views? Can we store a set of geometric representations from the EFT across time steps?

### Dynamic: 

Can the geometry captured at a given time step be matched to the geometry captured at t+1 if the object has moved a lot? Can the new views of this moved object be used to improve the 3D reconstruction?
Can we extract geometry aware features from a DYNAMIC scene with an Epipolar Feature Transformer (from SpareFusion)? We can use a view conditioned latent diffusion model to reconstruct unseen views of static objects, are we able to apply this dynamically?

  Method: "Given an input video sequence with N frames, our method jointly optimizes the camera poses, focal length, and static and dynamic radiance fields. We represent both the static and dynamic parts with explicit neural voxels Vs and Vd, respec- tively. The static radiance fields are responsible for recon- structing the static scene and estimating the camera poses and focal length. At the same time, the goal of dynamic radiance fields is to model the scene dynamics in the video (usually caused by moving objects)."

Method: 
"To enable plausible and 3D-consistent predictions, we instead take a two step approach as outlined in Figure 2. First, we learn a probabilistic view-synthesis model that, using geometry-guided diffusion, can model the distribution of images from query views given the sparse-view context (Section 4.1). While this allows generating detailed and di- verse outputs, the obtained renderings lack 3D consistency. To extract a 3D representation, we propose a 3D neural distillation process that ‘distills’ the predicted view distribu- tions into a consistent 3D mode (Section 4.2)."
